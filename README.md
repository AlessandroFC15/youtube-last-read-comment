## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx webpack`

The unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on
 the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension 
 into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Use `npx webpack` to recompile after editing.
